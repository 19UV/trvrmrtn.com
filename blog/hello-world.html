			<p>I think there is a list of things every programmer wants to do.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Make a compiler -- because X sucks.</li>
				<li>Write an operating system -- because X sucks.</li>
				<li>Create a game -- because it can't be worse then X.</li>
				<li>Become a monk -- because everything sucks.</li>
				<li>Make a website -- because everything is so. damn. slow.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Now, because I lack the funds to buy a plane ticket to Norway, I figured I may as well make a website.</p>

			<p>And because I didn't feel like learning a new framework, I figured HTML would be suffice.</p>

			<p>But before I actually post anything, I want to lay down some ground rules:</p>

			</br>

			<h1>The Blogger's Manifesto</h1>

			<p>This is a blog, and it should be nothing else.</p>

			<p>It shouldn't be fancy, it just needs to work.</p>

			<p>It shouldn't be pretty, as long as it's effective.</p>

			<p>It shouldn't follow best practices, as long as it works.</p>

			<p>It shouldn't be big, because bandwidth is precious.</p>

			<p>It shouldn't fast, because caching is the root of all evil.</p>

			<p>Most importantly: It shouldn't cost time.</p>

			</br>

			<p>
				This shouldn't be an ongoing project that requires maintinence. It should just work.
				I should be able to just post to it.
			</p>

			<p>Consiter this a promise to keep things simple.</p>

			</br>

			<p>That's everything for today,</p>
			<p>Cheers.</p>
